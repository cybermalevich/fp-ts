# shell.nix
#
# This file is used by the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/) to
# create a reproducible project environment across different computers.
#
# The main purpose of this file is to provide Ruby to allow contributing to the
# library documentation. It is not required to use Nix, you're free to bring
# your own Ruby.
#
# With Nix installed, you can run
#
#     nix-shell
#
# to enter a shell environment with the required tools available. Once there, run
#
#     npm run docs   (to update the documentation)
#     jekyll serve   (to start the documentation server)
#
# Nix can help manage Ruby dependencies more deterministically. The Ruby Gems for
# Nix are loaded from "gemset.nix", which is based on Rubyâ€™s "Gemfile.lock". To
# add or remove Gems, do the following:
#
#   1. Edit "Gemfile" to add/remove a gem
#   2. Update "Gemfile.lock" with `nix-shell -p bundler --run "bundle package --no-install --path vendor"`
#   3. Derive the "gemset.nix" expression by running `nix-shell -p bundix --run bundix`
